As machine learning algorithms used for building classifiers operate on numbers, not text, we must convert the collection of words/tokens in each tweet into an alternative form capable of encoding all of the information in a tweet in numeric form. These numeric representations can be used to calculate similarities between items, thus forming the basis for comparisons used in clustering and machine learning.\n",

The entry for each word will contain the number of times that that word occurs in the given tweet.

    "Basic classification and experiments with different test/train ratios seem to suggest that we have built a somewhat useful classifier. Let's try a different approach - what if we scramble the labels, arbitrarily assigning either `smoking` or `vaping` to each tweet?  Any classifiers built on such a model should have poor performance, as we'd essentially be removing any systematic connection between the tweets and the labels. If, on the other hand, such a model did perform well, we might wonderif we're seeing some sort of artifact and not necessarily a useful model. \n",
