As machine learning algorithms used for building classifiers operate on numbers, not text, we must convert the collection of words/tokens in each tweet into an alternative form capable of encoding all of the information in a tweet in numeric form. These numeric representations can be used to calculate similarities between items, thus forming the basis for comparisons used in clustering and machine learning.\n",

The entry for each word will contain the number of times that that word occurs in the given tweet.
