# Social Media Data Science

An exploration of the use of APIs, natural language, and text
processing to study online interactions via social media.  

Designed as a self-study, this module will take you through the process of retrieving, storing and analyzing tweets. Topics will include qualitative annotation, natural language processing, and classification using basic machine-learning methods. 

Content is provided in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](http://www.jupyter.org).  If you need an introduction to Jupyter, you can see the [official documents](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or this [Medium article](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

You can run these notebooks on a jupyterhub server - potentially one provided by your course - or on your own computer, appropriately configured with Python and other libraries.

The remainder of this document will discuss how to use these modules for your class work.

# Using the module

The following steps describe how to use these modules in a Jupyter environment.


## 1. Create a github or gitlab account

[Github](https://www.Github.com) and [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) are two popular community sites based on the Git source-code control system. We're going to use Git to create your own local copy of these modules, and to store any changes. We'll tell you a bit about it here, but there's much more to learn -  for more information on Git, see [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

For now, go to either [Github](https://www.Github.com) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) and create an account. Remember your account name.

## 2. Fork this repository into your GitHub or GitLab.com

"Fork" is a term used in Git to convey a copy of a code repository, made for the purposes of having a personal or private place to work that might diverge from the original (think of a fork in the road...). Here, you are going to create a fork of the repository, so that you might work on the modules on your own.  Below, we give different descriptions for GitHub and GitLab.

### 2.1 If you are using GitHub

1. Go to the home page of this repository. As you're reading this README file, you're probably there.
2. Press the button labeled "Fork" [fork](images/fork-clone.jpg). 
3. You will see a popup labeled "where should we fork this repository". Choose your account. 
4. You'll see a message indicating that something is happening.
5. When it is done, go to your home page. You should see a new repository. Go to the home page of that repository.

### 2.2 If you are using GitLab
1. Go to your GitLab homepage.
2. Click "+" in the top menu bar.
3. Select "New Project"
4. Click "Import Project" and then "Git Repo by URL"
5. At the top of the page containing this document, click on "Clone or download". Copy this URL
6. Paste this URL into the "Git repository URL" textbook on the GitLab import page.
7. Click "create project".  You can keep the repository to start.
8. You'll see a message indicating that something is happening.
9. When it is done, go to your home page. You should see a new repository. Go to the home page of that repository.

## 3. Start a Jupyter notebook.

1. Look at the top right of your Jupyer home page. There will be a menu labeled "New". Pull this menu down and select "Python 3". (seee this image [Python 3 notebook creation](images/newnotebook.png)). 

## 4. Clone project

## 5. Do your work

## 6. Consider pushing

## 7. Finish up

- push
- remove API keys
- make public
