# DONE
* Verify saved data
* what happens when a tweet is seen multiple times - I don't
  understand it?  ANSWER - this is an artifact of the search results. A tweet can be returned multiple times. filter it out an move on
* test with oop to see if I can read back in from file. - nope. not easily
* iterate through to check load vs. save
* section 4 reads in file..
* figure out why we don't necessarily get tweets in the same order when reading them in.  - revise approach to getting first. 100
  - get keys, sort by id, and then take first 100.
