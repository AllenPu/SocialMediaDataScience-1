    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of social-media discussions has grown to be an important tool for biomedical informatics researchers, particularly for addressing questions relevant to public perceptions of health and related matters. Studies have examination of a range of topics at the intersection of health and social media, including studies of how [Facebook might be used to commuication health information](http://www.jmir.org/2016/8/e218/) how Tweets might be used to understand how smokers perceive [e-cigarettes, hookahs and other emerging smoking products](https://www.jmir.org/2013/8/e174/), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each investigation has unique aspects, studies of social media generally share several common tasks. Data acquisition is often the first challenge: although some data may be freely available, there are often [limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits) as to how much data can be queried easily. Researchers might look out for [opportunities for accessing larger amounts of data](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/twitter-promises-share-secrets-academia/). Some studies contract with [commercial services providing fee-based access](https://gnip.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a data set is hand, the next step is often to identify key terms and phrases relating to the research question. Messages might be annotated to indicate specific categorizations of interest - indicating, for example, if a message referred to a certain aspect of a disease or symptom. Similarly, key words and phrases regularly occurring in the content might also be identified. Natural language and text processing techniques might be used to extract key words, phrases, and relationships, and machine learning tools might be used to build classifiers capable of distinguishing between types of tweets of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module presents a preliminary overview of these techniques, using Python 3 and several auxiliary libraries to explore the application of these techniques to Twitter data. \n",

Although details of the tools used to access data and the format and content of the data may differ for various services, the strategies and procedures used to analyze the data will generalize to other tools."

    "[Twitter](www.twitter.com) provides limited capabilities for searching tweets through an Application Programming Interface (API) based on Representational State Transfer (REST).  [REST](https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337228) is an approach to using web-based Hypertext-Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests as APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a REST API specifies conventions for HTTP requests that might be used to retrieve specific data items from a remote server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which return HTML markup to be rendered in web browsers, REST APIs return data formatted in XML or JSON, suitable for interpretation by computer programs. REST APIs from familiar websites underlie frequently-seen functionality such as embedded twitter widgets and \"like/share\" links, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial REST applications often use \"API-Keys\" - unique identifiers used to associate requests with registered accounts. Here, we will walk through the process of registering for Twitter API keys and using a Python library to manage the details of making a Twitter API request and receiving a response.\n",

    "1.1.1 *Signup for Twitter* The first step in registering for a Twitter API key is to [signup](https://twitter.com/signup) for an account. If you dont' want to post anything or to use the account in any way that might be linked to your regular email adddress, you might want to create a special-purpose account using a service such as gmail, and use this new email address for the twitter account.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.2. *Create a Twitter application*: Go to  [Twitter's developer site](https://dev.twitter.com) and click on \"My Apps\". Click on \"Create New App\" in the upper right and then fill out the form. The main thing that you need to focus on here is the application name, description, and website. The rest can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the application will lead to the display of some information with some URLs and a few tabs. Look under \"Keys and Access Tokens\" to see the Consumer API key and API Secret - these will come in handy later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will also be a button that says \"Create my access token\". Press this button and make a note of the Access Token and Access Token Secret values that are displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although hese tokens are always available on the application page, for the purpose of this exercise, it's best to store them in Python variables directly in this Jupyter notebook. Execute the following insstructions, substituting the keys for your application for the phrases \"YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY\", etc. "

Unlike sampling based on geographical constraints such as place of residence, data sampled from social media does not draw from any well-characterized population. More simply stated, we might know how many people live in a city or town, but we don't know how many people might have tweeted on a given topic at any given time. \n",
